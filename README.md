# [Project 1: Shortest Amount of Moves to Win 2048: Project Overview](https://github.com/CalebBal/Shortest_Path_to_2048)
* Created an algorithm that finds the shortest amount of moves it would take to reach 2048.
* Reads a matrix of numbers from an input file and the number of non-zero numbers in the matrix.
* Program generates random moves until 2048 is reached or all the non-zero numbers have been added and then outputs shortest path.
* Designed the program to keep 2048 stationary if 2048 was read in from the matrix input file.
* An "impossible" statement will be printed if matrix cannot be solved.
* Moves within the matrix are: move up = 1, move right = 2, move down = 3, and move left = 4.

# [Project 2: Message Decoder: Project Overview](https://github.com/CalebBal/Message_decoder)
* Created an algorithm that decodes messages with the commands given from an input file.
* Reads in a coded message and all the commands from an input file.
* Shorted all the commands based on the priority level given in the input file.
* Any commands with a higher priority before the coded message was read is disregarded.
* Printed the decoded message to an output file once all commands have been read.

# [Project 3: Problem Organizer Using Linked Lists: Project Overview](https://github.com/CalebBal/problem_organizer)
* Created an algorithm that organizes a list of problems with the commands given using linked lists.
* Reads an input file that has a list of problems with their ID, Name, and level of difficulty.
* Sorted each problem using linked lists.
* Read in commands for adjusting the list of problems from another input file.
* Printed out the final sorted list after all the commands were executed.
