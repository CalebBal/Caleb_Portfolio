# Project 1: Shortest Amount of Moves Finder to Win 2048: Project Overview
* Created an algorithm that finds the shortest amount of moves it would take to reach 2048.
* Reads a matrix of numbers from a file and the number of non-zero numbers in the matrix is given.
* Program generates random moves until 2048 is reached and outputs shortest path.
* Designed the program to keep 2048 stationary if 2048 was read in from the matrix input file.
* An "impossible" statement will be printed if matrix cannot be solved.
